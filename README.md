Problem Statement: 
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. The problem involves analyzing historical stock data, identifying patterns and trends, and using them to make predictions about future price movements. The goal is to build a model that can accurately forecast stock prices over a given time horizon, thus providing valuable insights for investment decision-making.
